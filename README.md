## Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body can’t use it as well as it should. Our bodies break down the food we eat into glucose and gets released into the bloodstream. When blood glucose levels go up, insulin should let the glucose into the body’s cells to be used for energy. When insulin is low, too much glucose stays in the bloodstream and can cause life threatening complications. Diabetes can be caused by genetics or lifestyle factors like eating and exercise habits. Over time, diabetes can lead to other serious problems like kidney disease, heart disease or vision loss.  

There are over 37 million adults in the US living with diabetes and many more that go undiagnosed. We chose this topic to help predict the probability of a person having diabetes using supervised machine learning models.
